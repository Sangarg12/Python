# What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python?
                                                        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling and automatic memory management which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.
                                                        The benefits of pythons are that it is simple and easy to understand, portable, extensible, build-in data structure and it is an open source.
