Request your support in creating a dashboard for PNQ10 UK team with Agent level- SIC wise(all four) information for quality metrics( RAP, CCX-U, CCX-H, CCX-K, CCX-A, CCX-F, overall CCX, Offer Rate, Resolve Rate, Handled Contacts, HMD Polls and Resolved Contacts)

1. Data should have the YTD numbers. We can have the date, week, month wise filters
2. We can have the dashboard with PG level, Ops level, contact channel, GRPM level, TM and CSA level filters
3. This dashboard should be refresh-able so that each day with the new data inputs numbers could be refreshed.
4. We need the inputs for audit portal updates done by TMs too to be a part of the dashboard.

Please connect with me or Shashi if you have queries or concerns.

- 2 HC were moved to Registry for training in week 04, however no alignment changes where shared to us until it was called out, and then we made the changes effective next week (WK05).

So after excluding the SMEs and the week 04 PTL data of the 2 CSAs who moved to Registry and underwent training, the PTL for January sums to 86.82% which is favorable to the goal of 81.54% by 6.48%

There is a success story for which we require to share the impact analysis.

Issue: In week 48, 2020, we received an issues with regards to the “product review emails” which the customer receives post the item gets delivered. We have received customer contacts where they are informing us about receiving the review emails even when the items are not delivered due to either DNR, lost or any other scenarios. The issue has been fixed now where customers will no longer receive those automated triggers until and unless an order is actually delivered. We want to know the total number of contacts received in 2020 where the order was not delivered but the customer received the automated trigger email.

Due to the nature of business and subjectivity , calculation of Quality & Productivity metrics' for SWAT Team Managers have remained a challenge.

                The data is sought, in pursuit of having a single data source/ dashboard to evaluate and compile the scorecards of all SWAT Team Managers working across all the CS INDIA Sites  , month on month.

Hope you doing well!

As discussed with you over the chime there are few corrections observed from Q1'21 on PNQ10 IN Socrecard. Would need your help to review these corrections. 1) New corrections due to changes in the goals for TMs and unavailability 2) Corrections were adjusted by you but these changes were shared on SIM and not updated on drive.
So would need your help to get these Q1'21 corrections done and add to the drive since the drive data is consider for any internal review and discussion. If the inputs are not captured on the drive, we may miss out the actual performance.

Sweta - Requesting your approval.

                (We work on multiple priority items at a given point and this will help us with the queue and determine automation opportunities, if any)
In CJB10, few CSAs are moved to CA MU from NA email and CA email. We observed that they are not following MU protocol of closing the contact within 5 seconds after the last phrase. This is having an impact on CHT and it might fall under HMD solicitation, as inline HMD will not be taken by the customer. And we're also trying to observe whether low TTC is having a positive impact on RAP.

C.            What are Attributes that you want to look at:
                (eg: Agent, Manager, Region, Marketplace, Contact type, Skill, ASIN etc.,)

D.            What are Metrics that you want to measure for the above attributes:
                (eg: PRR, Transfers, RAP, Concessions, etc.,)
RAP, TTC, CHT

E.            What are the filters that you think we should apply.(If not sure, please schedule a meeting with Analyst once the SIM is assigned based on Description - eg: Contact type = email, chat / Region = IN, NA / Amazon Hierarchy = Consumer)

The form contacts will be having subject ""Transfer request for CAP from .COM Retail"" / "".CA Retail"". 

Attributes: 

1. Skills which submitted the form - We need to know how many forms were submitted by CSAs from retail skill wise (Phone, email, chat, MU) 

2. We need HMD response data (Yes, no, Repeats) 

3. Boomerang transfers ( CAP transfer contacts, that are transferred back to retail i.e contacts from work category CAP to Generalist).

4. Call Center

5. Contact ID

Description of the issue- 

On event of Power issue CSA's working from home use System Aux, this aux determines the downtime of CSA. UPS does not supply power to the router and hence power backup is not completely helpful. 

We are trying to understand the impact through total System aux for each site in VCS. This is common issue irrespective of the OU hence need the data for VCS Sites , all OU , for Year till date. 

Please connect with me , would be able to explain more about the requirement.

We need your help with transfer Data from 1st January to 31st Oct 2020 in the below format for the below mentioned skills only.

We need contacts which were handled in a month/in below skills + out of these handles we need to check transfer contacts which were transferred FROM below mentioned skills TO any Skills in Amazon, in the below mentioned format.

Also, our primary concern is about the number of times a SINGLE contact transferred to multiple skills, the count in the end of column + skills names (in multiple columns) in which it was transferred to.

we would need data separately , month wise, to avoid big file lag issues. 10 months data, in 10 separate reports.

Attached a sample file for reference.

Please feel free to contact me Ill be happy to provide more inputs on this.
 
Column Names: Skill | Contact id | HMD Yes, No | Transferred From(Skill) | Transferred To(Skill 1 Name) | Transferred To(Skill 2 Name)| Transferred To(Skill 3 Name) so on

Please provide the following details: 
1) Follow-up HMD query:  The request is to write query on Contacts with follow-up's - Comparing the HMD sent on initial contact Vs Follow-up reply option. CS Ops teams have been observed they close loop Cx on follow-ups by making OB calls and send the HMD on the OB contacts itself. This is resulting in XX% of OB call HMD not being considered in RAP.

2) OB Call HMH query: The request is to understand the HMD adherence on OB calls made on follow-ups.

1. Order_id's/Replacement order_id's which exist in the concessions table that were manually conceded by CS agents but do not have a record in the contacts tables
2. Gift certificates that were greater than the our_price of the item conceded.

Order channel (AFN/FBA/MFN)
This will likely need to be done by also leveraging the csinsight.fact_contact_asins_na joined to the csinsight.dim_order_channel table.

Hope you doing well!
Kindly update the scorecard for the TM's with the corrected scores and exception .
Many TMs had FTC employee reporting to them in the month of March and they were on pre approved HR Garden leaves which impacted their shrinkage and PTL for few .
For few TMs the connection score points are not added in the scorecard for March .

I need the time taken for an associate to park a MU contact and also time taken for the associate to close the contact.

TTC (time to close) is a metric that calculates time taken by an associate to close a contact, Time To Park(TTP) that calculates the time taken by an associate to park a contact.

Contact Type : Message Us

Below details are requested :
Marketplace : amazon.in , amazon.co.uk, amazon.com
Site
Contact ID

Time to closure
Time to Park

TTP (time to park) = chat park time - last message of chat.

With reference to previous SIM https://sim.amazon.com/issues/CSDA-IND-3867 - some data is missing and we need additional inputs as well hence raising another SIM , Pls assign this to kaatul@ basis previous discussion with sriram. 

Hello Atul,
With reference to SIM : https://sim.amazon.com/issues/CSDA-IND-3867
1)	Repurchase at lower price needs to be expanded up to 30 days  from date of return 
2)	Clarity – aggregate same contact  is it within 48 hours ?
3)	For all the requests : we will need a summary TAB : requested in SIM : https://sim.amazon.com/issues/CSDA-IND-3867   [similar to earlier summary given by DA hussshe@ in SIM https://sim.amazon.com/issues/CSDA-IND-3099 ]

Total contact / PM contacts / of the price match contact / how many ret and repurchased within 14 / within 30 /   hat is $  of repurchase  with qty multiplier) 
4)	“-- promo or gc column needs to be added as well of the original order as there can be instances where cx took the promo gc and still returned and repurchased it.” requested in SIM  https://sim.amazon.com/issues/CSDA-IND-3867  pls ignore if factored 
5)	Expand the summary – point 3…  for 18/91/20 to MKPL  CA/DE/FR/UK/IN/BR/MX/JP/ES/AU/
6)	Can we get Zappos data on price match for 18/19/20 /  $ value ? 

7)	Apart from above data: We will also need data for below 2 scenarios  in separate files:
Scenario 1:
I.	For the first time customer contacted us for price difference of non-returnable item.
II.	Post first contact a return is generated for ASIN/Order on same CX account :  where customer mentioned that product is damaged/defective takes a  complete return less refund . [he may have made the 2nd contact or not] 
III.	Difference in the $ value for the 2 orders purchased with same ASIN if the second purchase price is lower than first for same ASIN

Scenario 2:  Customer contacts us for item which is not been delivered and has the same day CSC date, they call in just few hours prior to the end of CSC date and time. As per the policy and process we ask them to wait for till the CSC date. And customer finds it frustrating to wait for few more hours rather than offering price match.
We need the data for this scenario for below points :

1.	Contact id level data for customer contacted us for TSDBNR [Tracking shows delivered but did not receive] issue on the same day of CSC date. [we accept the error but cant issue due to CSC date]
2.	Customer contacting us back again after placing the new order with same ASIN at higher price for price difference. [this is repeat contact  as cannot keep a follow up in MU and hence ask the CX to contact us again – not a good point for CX  considering the failure is AMzs ownership]
3.	Difference in the  $ value for the orders purchased with same ASIN

8) Contact volume SIC Code (Retail generalist) level vs skill/ work group (Price Match) [% of primary contacts Vs price match  & another column for  % of price match contacts handled by price match core and other teams]
9) return rate/ volume of returns related to price match policy - Both RML & ORC 
10) Price match Contacts received within 7/14/30 days of item being shipped needs to be added as 3 distinguishing colums as % of contact within 7/14/30 & beyond 
11) rate of customers who return the item after contacting CS (with/without concessions)? - basically this will be : (no or CX initiating a return within 14-30 days and also repurchasing the product at lower price/ no of CX reaching out for Price match ( price match SIC ) 

Few more questions:  
1)	Is concessions data on  price match policies overall or only those who have returned and repurchased  at lower price ?  ( it should be overall)
2)	Pls add when CX has contacted us for pricing match related issues within 7/14/30 days as additional request to below points ( adding this in SIM as well)
3)	Similarl of the total concession given on these SICs what % of  concession is given by retail and what % by Viking .


Pls connect on my cell for any queries .

Requesting you to provide the data of Contacts with the scenario where Customer leaves the chat and at the same time next CSA joins the chat. 

Impact: As the chat is parked by the previous CSA, Cx has the option to end the chat. At this instance Cx ends the chat and the parked chat gets connected to the next CSA. This is resulting the contacts closed by the customer and accepted by the next CSA at the same time. This results in HMD being offered for the new CSA as the contact is ended by one  of the parties. In most of the cases the final CSA received NO response for the HMD as it is inline HMD offering.

Sample Contact id: IN MU

I require data around this:

When an item is marked as Undeliverable and returned to our FC, a refund gets automatically issued and customers are not given any option to choose the type of concession. We should actually give our customer options to choose whether they want the refund to Original payment method or GC because refund to OPM takes between 4-7 business days and sometimes our customer will want the item immediately, hence, GC would be a quicker option or even a replacement option when the item is retail.

Requesting you to kindly get us data around the above issue.

As we know that the CSIndia UK Quick sight dashboard has received positive feedback from multiple sites, I’m coordinating with the UK Internal site POCs on their requirement and post having the conversation with CPT, VCS-ZAF and AMM sites, the only request they have is to get the view of their site’s performance against the network achieved and OP2 which we can see in the section named ‘CSINDIA Consumer and CS support’ on our dashboard.

B.            Data Request Description: Please help us with the business context and justification about how this data will help you:

Hello team,

The intent of raising this SIM is to understand the trend of the agent abuse regarding conference time for Q4.

To iterate what conference time is....Generally when an agent X transfers the call to agent Y (warm transfer) and introduces the cx, the agent X is supposed to leave the ""conference"" and proceed with attending the next cx contact. 

Wile monitoring RTM, I have noticed multiple instances where the agent X is not exiting the conference and is staying on mute/hold throughout the call duration where agent Y assists the cx and wraps up the call. 

PFA the snip of agent X's status in RTM where the agent post warm transfer - has not left the conference and the RTM shows agent state as ""busy"".

I'm specifically looking for the duration of the contact where its state was in conference. (highlighted in snip)

Kindly help me with the data in the excel template attached. Feel free to reach out to me for any clarifications.

Scenario 2: Customer contacts us for item which is not been delivered and has the same day CSC date, they call in just few hours prior to the end of CSC date and time. As per the policy and process we ask them to wait for till the CSC date. And customer finds it frustrating to wait for few more hours rather than offering price match.
We need the data for this scenario for below points :

1. Contact id level data for customer contacted us for TSDBNR [Tracking shows delivered but did not receive] issue on the same day of CSC date. [we accept the error but cant issue due to CSC date]
2. Customer contacting us back again after placing the new order with same ASIN at higher price for price difference. [this is repeat contact as cannot keep a follow up in MU and hence ask the CX to contact us again – not a good point for CX considering the failure is AMzs ownership]
3. Difference in the $ value for the orders purchased with same ASIN

8) Contact volume SIC Code (Retail generalist) level vs skill/ work group (Price Match) [% of primary contacts Vs price match & another column for % of price match contacts handled by price match core and other teams]
9) return rate/ volume of returns related to price match policy - Both RML & ORC
10) Price match Contacts received within 7/14/30 days of item being shipped needs to be added as 3 distinguishing colums as % of contact within 7/14/30 & beyond
11) rate of customers who return the item after contacting CS (with/without concessions)? - basically this will be : (no or CX initiating a return within 14-30 days and also repurchasing the product at lower price/ no of CX reaching out for Price match ( price match SIC )",Resolved,Comment,requester,de64ad06-471a-4282-ae58-9a56f7fe8e6d,Misc,d03d28c1-c2f8-4557-82cd-93ccccb8ffc0,DE Sprint,bhikes,kaatul,kaatul,2021-02-02T16:01:54.012Z,2021-02-15T18:11:39.959Z,2021-02-15T18:11:39.959Z,2021-02-15T18:11:39.959Z,kaatul,,,0,0,3,,0,3f9d17da-b31f-411e-9e20-d1552e608db0,1,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,0,HYD,,

I require data around 2 points:

Issue 1: CS operations team (UK) made a feature request for promotional credit bifurcation tab on CSC. Promo credits currently do not have a centralised tab to show which orders have had promotional credits applied either partially or fully as a payment method for an order. In order to check this, CSAs need to manually go order by order and this creates a negative CSA experience as well as increases their overall CHT. Currently, in CSC, we do have a feature where we can see the bifurcation for the Gift certificates utilization on different orders and the same request is being made for Promotional credits. For Gift certificates, there is a tab in Account level that CSAs can navigate to which lists the gift certificates and the orders in which they were used as a payment method. 

Issue 2: Raised by me as a feature request for Returns and refunds: When a refund is issued, for a brief period of time the status of the refund stays in blue (processing state) which can be seen under the Returns & Refunds tab. While it is processing (blue color), it doesn't provide us the information about the instrument in which the refund has been issued (gift card or payment card). We have seen multiple instances where the customers have contacted us asking for the instrument in which the previous CSA has issued the refund and as the current CSA will not be having visibility on the instrument to which the refund was issued while the refund is in Blue, hence, the current CSA often cancels the refund and reissues it. Only, once the refund processing is done(color changes to green), we can see the instrument to which it was issued, the request here is to incorporate the feature which will display the refund instrument too while the refund is being processed*blue)

Both the above issue is currently being looked into by the Worldwide Concession team POC(Sara Hibbard;murphysa@) who has found both the issues interesting and willing to incorporate if not in CSC then in Cara-Cara but she wants data around this to substantiate the kind of positive impact it will have on our internal customers and external customers.

Requesting you to kindly get us data around the above two issues.

Your support is appreciated!

Regards,
Abhishek

a)	Yadav Ajay : yadja@ 

1)	Actual RAP for Oct’2020 was at 69.34%% again the goals of 83.38% with -16.84% variance owing to performance of CSA’s (birkaran@ and mamdyala@) who moved to CA and were reporting to joyjoel@ and kastup@. Excluding their performance only 1 CSA’s was reporting to me whose RAP is at 100.00% against the goal of 23.95% with 317.54% (15 points to be added)
2)	RAP Met% for the Team was at 100% as only 21CSA’s have taken contacts who met the RAP goal (10 points to be added)
3)	Actual CHT (incl. contacts handled on Nautilus) was at 0.66 again the goal of 0.91 with 27.99% variance (15 points to be added)
4)	CHT Met% for the Team was at 69.23% as 18 CSA’s out of 26 have met the goal (6.92 points to be added)
b)	Chaitanya Surana : The shrinkage goal is reflecting as 3% , which is incorrect.  As per MBR file, shrinkage goal is 30.4%. – request  you to do needful and correct
c)	Neha roderkar : rodekarn@  : Attrition tagged to TM for the month of November for kshtv@ was involuntary and we are awaiting HR exception for this approval and wil share the same with you . Meanwhile raising this with your team , but this should be processed only if we have HR approvals and provide the status of same by 30th Jan
d)	Prakash pantuwap : pantuwap@ : Shrinkage Goal mentioned was 6% instead of 28.50%, which would add 10 points for Shrinkage.
e)	Sachin Kapse : Shrinkage Goal mentioned was 5.77% instead it shold be reffered from MBR file and actual shrinkage is 21.29% which will add points for Shrinkage.

f) kutwal@ is validating and will udpate the TT if changes are received.

Description of the issue- 

we receive multiple contacts on daily basis with the subject line and queue named as """"Presumed-lost@"""". presumed-lost contacts are auto generated but they are impacting us. This is because,  the refund or replacement request is being generated multiple times for the same order and the contacts are being locked to different agents. 

Also, sometimes, the same order refund or replacement multiple requests got locked to 1 CSA  and hence they have to duplicate the contact and then issue refunds or  replacements , 

If the duplication of the contacts is reduced or removed then it would help us in resolving the other contacts which need our assistance and also this helps in having a control on our CHT too indirectly. 

eg - ""first contact which was locked to CSA  where CSA  issued refund-A2AKOUQB91CCZA
Second contact which locked to same CSA  for the same order-A2F3QANACNSG22""

WHAT IS NEEDED -  

Across India on a weekly basis multiple follow up's are being missed. Follow up team was formed across CS India to mitigate the impact. A query was already created earlier with https://sim.amazon.com/issues/CSDA-IND-4593. We just need an additional RCR column attached to it by creating a temp table to the existing query

Problem Statement
There have been multiple instances with multiple customers who are not at all satisfied with USPS delivery. They believe that the carrier never delivers the item or just mark it as ""Available to pick up"" which clearly defeats the purpose of Prime shipping and online ordering. There are multiple instances where USPS fails to deliver important item of people passed EDD. Customer gets frustrated as soon as they see that the Carrier assigned to their package is USPS. This directly affects the trust people have on Amazon.

This is to bring in notice that in many case especially for third party seller order or even FBA Product getting delivered by third party delivery partners, where the product is been dispatched via third party courier including Indian Postal Service, customer contacts CS to cancel the order (when it gets delayed) the Agents normally fill the 3P Courier Feedback Form (for Stop & Return) and manually issue the refund.

In many cases the refund is also getting issued and the order is also getting delivered on later stages as stop & Return doesn't work.

Impact : The Stop & Return form submitted is either incorrect/delayed due to which refund and order both are getting issued to CX.

The Raw data attached for the ready reference and other attributes required to be updated.

The Attributes to be updated are :

orderId	contactId	typeofissue	Hold package date  _submissionUserId	_submissionDate	_submissionUserName	form-id	Delivery Partner Name 	Tracking Status	Delivered ( Y/N)	Refund issued( If Any )	Repeat Contact

My Shift timings are 9AM - 6 PM ( Sat & Sun off)

Thanks,
Nishat K

Yes/No: No


B.            Data Request Description: Please help us with the business context and justification about how this data will help you.
Ans: In the concession workflow for issuing refund for lost package cases, concession workflow gives an option to create ‘Refund of shipment in transit’ which basically is to arm Retrocharge in case the tracking is updated as delivered at later point of time but most of the time refund fails and only RML is created. Now that an active RML has been created the system no longer provides option of refund unless the 2 weeks period of return date crosses. This creates problem where it has already been established that package is lost. And asking customer to wait for 2 weeks for the refund is impacting customer experience

Need to analyze impact due to this for which we need below mentioned data so that we can improve on customer experience.


C.            What are Attributes that you want to look at:
                (eg: Agent, Manager, Region, Marketplace, Contact type, Skill, ASIN etc.,)
Ans: US Marketplace. Data range 2020 and 2021. Need to get count of orders where concession workflow failed to generate refund amount when concession option of 'Refund of shipment in transit' was selected. 

D.            What are Metrics that you want to measure for the above attributes:
 Ans:           Count of impacted orders.


E.            What are the filters that you think we should apply.(If not sure, please schedule a meeting with Analyst once the SIM is assigned based on Description - eg: Contact type = email, chat / Region = IN, NA / Amazon Hierarchy = Consumer)

As soon as possible

Please note - need data for Q3 and till date

Data needed - Conference time on transfer calls

bassically i had this data however the detail is not captured correctly.
Data that i get weekly has conference time but it captures the time when the 1st agent connects to 2nd agents which gives incorrect conference time.
ideally - it should be when the 1st agent is done speaking with 2nd agent and gets the customers in coneferce to transfer it to 2nd agent is when the conference time should be captured

Description - 

 Images sent by customers, Returns of CAP customers

The Images from cx in NA mrkt place are sent through email medium,It is effecting the customer experience as they need to attach the copy in email and send it to us and sometimes customers won't be able to reply as this is a tedious process and also it is time consuming.It is also effecting the work force in a way the image sent by customers will be regarded as a email contact which we need to annotate and close. Instead we could update the chat medium with a camera icon where cx can click or send a screen shot to us and it will be dealt in the first contact.Amazon is known to make it easier for the customers this was a suggestion from many customers as well.

How  much volume for images we ask on chats and Message us  and  email contacts where customer send only attachments  , and where  were havent replied and just wrapped it up or duplicated it  etc .

D. What are Metrics that you want to measure for the above attributes:
After call work and CHT (Outbound)

Need help with fetching the data for AU billing request related contacts. As part of the form deprecation project for AU, billing request form is being deprecated and alternate strategy is being proposed to launch cross skill transfer between 'Retail' and 'Account Change/Back Office (ACBO)' across channels for better CX and lesser lead time for the customers. In 2020, AU CSA's filled 7.1K forms for various billing/payments related queries to the ACBO team, which increases the overall lead time for the customer's request to be addressed.

We want to check the overall time taken to resolve the customers query from the time form was filled by the retail CSA's. For Ex: Retail CSA with contact ID X fills the form and that form contact Y is resolved by the BO CSA, we want to check the time difference between X & Y and also a flag if the customer contacted for X before Y was resolved. I'm also attaching the form contact ID data for your reference which you can run the analysis for.

*Please provide the **""detailed explanation""** of the data you are looking for and the purpose of it to get a better understanding of the request.* **(If in case the data request is not clear, sim will not be assigned)**

We are looking for order ids where payment is declined and the number of emails sent to the customer for payment decline for each order. Below is the problem statement we are framing

X customers undergo payment decline while placing an order an average per week. Of these X% of customers have orders with multiple items. It has been observed that when a payment is declined customers get a revise payment link for each item in the order. For instance, 10 items in one order receive 10 revise payment links at different timestamps. However, the customer is only able to revise the payment for the order after the link is triggered for the last item in the order.

The dump for network level is already getting updated in the drive. The only issue is that it also contains data for 2020 and due to size it cannot be copied in excel format. We only need data for current year. Hence, requesting to make the required changes and update the dump with data of current year only.

Below is the path for the dump and excel is attached for your reference for required fields.

I require data around this:

IN NA OU, Prepaid cards are treated as credit cards. Most customers dispose card upon using them. When they initiate return in ORC and opt for original payment method as refund method, refund goes to the prepaid card which they disposed. Post this, customers are contacting us to change the refund method to GC. We can't apply refund to Amazon GC if refund is already past the cancellation stage. We can offer pre-paid card as a New Payment Method when adding it to account and a notification to opt for GC as refund method in ORC while creating returns for orders paid with prepaid card. 

I tried to get contact results from CSC contact search tool with the below keyword combinations. I was able to obtain 1185 results excluding phone contacts. I've not audited the contacts. I've attached the spreadsheet with sample contact IDs. 

I need help in obtaining how many number of contacts we received since 2021 related to prepaid card refund at NA OU. Requesting you to kindly get us data around the above issue.

Your support is appreciated!

Many Thanks,
Nirmal

I need data around this.

For 2020 Q4, with week and month cut, we need to know the total number of shipments shipped per FC.
Further, how many got stuck and missed their EDD.
How many contacts generated for WMS per order.
Approximate number of trouble tickets raised for order stuck related issue

I have attached sample stuck shipment related contacts taken using contact search tool and also another file with list of Amazon FC names in  KC reference. FC names can be used to narrow down tickets related to that FC.  

Attributes:

fc, FC name, 
marketplace_name - Amazon.com/Amazon.ca, 
week, month, year 
total_shipment	
total_repeats	
edd	
stuck_count	
stuck_shipment	
case_id	
wms_total_contacts
comm_id if available and concessions issued on the contacts

Numbers related to tickets:
number of auto resolved tickets
number of tickets resolved with Age more than 1 week.

One more unique request - Is it possible to track number of tickets cut from a specific job title ? CSA & DART. If Yes, we need data of stuck shipment tickets specifically cut by CSA and DART in Q4

Requirement : In the created dashboard - we would like to add a new data point and publish Scorecard for the Month of May,2021.

                   TM Wise : Team RAP Met %
                   TM Wise : Team CHT Met % 
                    Eg RAP : TM A = Total Headcount - 10
                                       Number of Associates meeting individual weighted RAP Goal : 6
                                       Team RAP Met % = 6/10 = 60%

                    Eg CHT : TM B = Total Headcount - 10
                                       Number of Associates meeting individual weighted CHT Goal : 8
                                       Team CHT Met % = 8/10 = 80% 

Further, we wish to add scorecard points' logic based on the variance ( to be discussed / share post discussion ).

===================================================================
Hello Team,

Would request your help in creating a real-time performance dashboard . This dashboard is required to present data for all the CSAs and then calculate weighted score after incorporating assigned weightage to the metric subsequently resulting in the stack ranking of all the CSA's.
This data will be the basis of Performance improvement plan (PIP) for all CSAs. It needs to ensure that stack ranking is done respectively for each site as we need to move bottom 20% of the skill from each site in a PIP cycle. We also need to ensure that data is getting updated weekly or biweekly to provide performance update to the CSAs.

As of now this will be run as a pilot for NA Message channel at CS India Level.

Metrics in focus:- RAP, CHT, Park Rate and Transfer Rate.
Weightage contribution:- RAP - 30%; CHT-30%; Park Rate-20%; Transfer Rate- 20%.
Qualifier for PIP:- Minimum handle contacts- 150 ; Minimum HMD polls to be sent - 100
If Not met - NA category
Benchmark Weighted Score:- ( RAP OP2*0.3)+(CHT OP2*0.3) + ( PARK % Network Achieved*0.2) + ( TRANSFER % Network Achieved*0.2)
If anyone is better than this score after meeting cut off, same will not be falling in to PIP cycle.


Please provide the following details:

A.            Is the requested information not available from available reports on Redhawk/CSInsight/Existing reports?

                (We work on multiple priority items at a given point and this will help us with the queue and determine automation opportunities, if any)
  CS India quality team follows a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) mechanism where in the focus is on two parameters, Quality PIP which consist of RAP as a metric and Efficiency PIP consisting of CHT metric. We have conducted the thorough deep dive using historic PIP data of last 4 months (Dec’20-Mar’21) for CS India sites to understand the impact on input metrics for these CSAs. It was observed that many CSAs in PIP had alarmingly high park and transfer percentage enabling them to refrain from moving into PIP or getting into subsequent PIP cycles. This leads to poor customer experience and hinders first contact resolution.

===================================================================

*****PLS REFER PREVIOUS TICKET****** : https://sim.amazon.com/issues/CSDA-IND-5382 
We are looking for additional inputs based on previous ticket to proceed further with the idea for implementation



Please provide the following details:

A.            Is the requested information not available from available reports on Redhawk/CSInsight/Existing reports?
(https://redhawk.aka.corp.amazon.com/ and https://csinsight.amazon.com/)

Answer : No


B.            Data Request Description: Please help us with the business context and justification about how this data will help you.
                (We work on multiple priority items at a given point and this will help us with the queue and determine automation opportunities, if any)

We are working on a project for PNQ10 Ideathon 2021. 
Idea background: Whenever customers return an item, the return tracking page (also visible to the customer) displays “Refunds are processed within 7 days once we receive your return. Shortly after, you'll receive an e-mail message confirming your refund.” Email that is sent to the customer says: “We've accepted your return request. Once we receive the item below, we'll issue your refund.” Meanwhile, our returns policy blurb “return_refund_process” on KC recommends: “Once the carrier has received your package, it can take up to two weeks for us to receive and process your return”. Owing to different policy statements communicated to our customers on different platforms, customers contact Amazon CS with their queries related to the refund status. This is often before the stipulated policy wait time which is 2 weeks, leading to concessions & promotional certificates being issued before policy wait period.

Idea problem statement: After mining 51 Amazon Us Primary MessageUs contacts (taken between 26th May to 11th June 2021) it was found that Amazon CS team received 49.02% of contacts from customers before the ideal stipulated time of 2 weeks. 36% of contacts had concessions issued before the ideal wait time amounting to 1267.84$. Customer experience takes a hit along with concessions and promo certificates being issued before the ideal policy wait period owing to different policy statements that are communicated with customers related to returns. 

***Important****
We need additional data inputs on contact IDs in North America Consumer Space which have RMAs created and customer have contacted Customer service after returning the item checking for their refund. All SICs


**We received data in previously cut ticket. Pls refer to prev sim:  https://sim.amazon.com/issues/CSDA-IND-5382

C.            What are Attributes that you want to look at:

1. Timeframe: Jan to Dec 2020  (full year) + Jan to July 2021 

2. We are looking for contact IDs in North America Consumer Space which have RMAs created and customer have contacted Customer service after returning the item checking for their refund. All SICs

3.  Pls check if we can have return center link mapped against each contact ID. 

4. If possible, pls map the date when the carrier received the item submission from customer in DD/MM/YYYY format

5. Date on which customer contacted customer service in DD/MM/YYYY format

6. If possible, pls add a row where we can see the difference in the number of days for 
-Day on which customer contacted CS - (minus) Day on which the carrier received the item from customer. 

7. Align the promo if any issued on the contact , we would be looking for the value of Promo in $

8. Was any concession issued? Yes/No , if Yes, then what was the value of concession in $. Concession can be considered as a refund initiated by customer service associate.  

7. Mode of concession - OPM/ GC 

8. Pls add a row where we can view when exactly did the item get processed at FC ( Date)

I require data around this:

When an item is marked as Undeliverable and returned to our FC, a refund gets automatically issued and customers are not given any option to choose the type of concession. We should actually give our customer options to choose whether they want the refund to Original payment method or GC because refund to OPM takes between 4-7 business days and sometimes our customer will want the item immediately, hence, GC would be a quicker option or even a replacement option when the item is retail.

Requesting you to kindly get us data around the above issue.

Your support is appreciated!

Regards,
Abhishek

previous sim: https://issues.amazon.com/issues/CSDA-IND-3674

we need the same data as requested through above sim, but YTD on weekly basis. For example: On every Sunday, if we could get offer rate data from 1st Jan 2021 till Saturday, MTD, WTD format it would be helpful.

a small change: if we could get the logins using skill name + site (PNQ10),then it would be easy for us to maintain, I could help you with logins but it changes every week, few come and leave skill.

We have observed cases where incorrect refunds were getting processed for pantry items, where in if there are 30 items in an order the automated refund gets processed to 25 items and cx had to contact amazon. CSA will have hard time identifying the exact product to which refund was missed. This is usually happening to those cases where refunds were processed automatically (undeliverable, lost in transit etc.,).

Chat transfer rate is high for CJB10. Upon mining the contact we understood that particular skill had high impact. 

AmazonEnglishAmazonExportMobileChat - transfer rate is 93% per week. 

Requesting to provide skill wise transfer data, contact Id and total handles/agent and skill.  Requesting to provide recurring data to analyze weekly impact. 

1) Data request : AmazonEnglishAmazonExportMobileChat  to Supervisor transfer chat. 

Why it is required: We're unable to check final destination queue once after the contact is transferred. We can only see that it was transferred to supervisor chat.

2) Data request : PrimaryCAChat  to US primary Chat. CA contacts which was transferred to .com primary team.

A. Is the requested information not available from available reports on Redhawk/CSInsight/Existing reports?
(https://redhawk.aka.corp.amazon.com/ and https://csinsight.amazon.com/)

Yes/No: Not available, as final destination queue is not present after the contact transfer.

B. Data Request Description: Please help us with the business context and justification about how this data will help you.
(We work on multiple priority items at a given point and this will help us with the queue and determine automation opportunities, if any)

We are checking an option to reduce Chat transfer rate.

C. What are Attributes that you want to look at:

Attributes : Total Handles/agent, skill, OU, skill, Month, Week, date, transfer destination

D. What are Metrics that you want to measure for the above attributes:

Marketplace : Amazon.com
Contact type : all
Time Range : Jan 2020 (Amazon.com)
Recurring data : Yes / week

E. What are the filters that you think we should apply.(If not sure, please schedule a meeting with Analyst once the SIM is assigned based on Description - eg: Contact type = email, chat / Region = IN, NA / Amazon Hierarchy = Consumer)

Marketplace : Amazon.com
Contact type : all
Time Range : Jan 2020 (Amazon.com) 
Site : CJB 10

Data mentioning the prepaid Order ID's where refunds have been issued to the customer after few months(4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11 but not more than a year) of order being placed for different reasons such as delayed pickup due to 'IN-APP verification failure, exception for refund on return by CS, Product turned defective and Customer is unable to claim warranty, etc.,'. 

Reason for request : It seems that the refund reference numbers for such order are not being automatically sent to the customer even if the order is not older than a year. 

I would be available for 10 AM - 7 PM shift from Sun-Thurs.

We want to compare this value across different forecast groups in the IN Consumer space. i have already written a query to calculate same. I will attach the query as well as the data output on the SIM.

I believe the query is giving me the concessions data but resolved_contacts is coming out to be decimals  which should not be the case. I want to find an accurate source for contacts data so we can create a business case for this. I want this data for Q4 2020

As soon as possible

Please note - need data for Q3 and till date

Data needed - Conference time on transfer calls
Need it on daily bases - so that i have a daily,weekly and month view 

bassically i had this data however the detail is not captured correctly.
Data that i get weekly has conference time but it captures the time when the 1st agent connects to 2nd agents which gives incorrect conference time.
ideally - it should be when the 1st agent is done speaking with 2nd agent and gets the customers in coneferce to transfer it to 2nd agent is when the conference time should be captured

The planned prod hours at interval level for New Hires in CA_Primary_Phone at HYD are showing 1 per interval whereas it should be 0.5 where no breaks or lunch is scheduled. It is happening for the current week. 
Similarly where breaks and lunches are scheduled it is showing 1.25 and 1.5 resp. Owing to which the schedule adherence and Schedule conformance for the skill is showing very low. Below is the list of logins for reference. For WS 16th May, we have uploaded the NPTs from 19:00 to 20:30 and 02:30 to 04:00 IST for all the CSAs.

===================================================================

Please provide the following details:

A.            Is the requested information not available from available reports on Redhawk/CSInsight/Existing reports?
(https://redhawk.aka.corp.amazon.com/ and https://csinsight.amazon.com/)

Answer : No


B.            Data Request Description: Please help us with the business context and justification about how this data will help you.
                (We work on multiple priority items at a given point and this will help us with the queue and determine automation opportunities, if any)

We are working on a project for PNQ10 Ideathon 2021. 
Idea background: Whenever customers return an item, the return tracking page (also visible to the customer) displays “Refunds are processed within 7 days once we receive your return. Shortly after, you'll receive an e-mail message confirming your refund.” Email that is sent to the customer says: “We've accepted your return request. Once we receive the item below, we'll issue your refund.” Meanwhile, our returns policy blurb “return_refund_process” on KC recommends: “Once the carrier has received your package, it can take up to two weeks for us to receive and process your return”. Owing to different policy statements communicated to our customers on different platforms, customers contact Amazon CS with their queries related to the refund status. This is often before the stipulated policy wait time which is 2 weeks, leading to concessions & promotional certificates being issued before policy wait period.

Idea problem statement: After mining 51 Amazon Us Primary MessageUs contacts (taken between 26th May to 11th June 2021) it was found that Amazon CS team received 49.02% of contacts from customers before the ideal stipulated time of 2 weeks. 36% of contacts had concessions issued before the ideal wait time amounting to 1267.84$. Customer experience takes a hit along with concessions and promo certificates being issued before the ideal policy wait period owing to different policy statements that are communicated with customers related to returns. 

***Important****
We need additional data inputs on contact IDs in North America Consumer Space which have RMAs created and customer have contacted Customer service after returning the item checking for their refund. This can probably be achieved by looking for contact IDs where SIC selected was ""Return processing delayed by FC""  by the CSA. 

Contact IDs requested in different mediums

1. 150 contact IDs from NA Message Us (June 2021) : However, if possible Pls give us all contact IDs in June 2021 for NA MU
2. 50 contact IDs from NA Phones (June 2021)
3. 50 contact IDs from NA Emails (June 2021) 


**We've attached a sample Excel format with this sim in order to provide better clarity on the format of the data requested. 


C.            What are Attributes that you want to look at:
                (eg: Agent, Manager, Region, Marketplace, Contact type, Skill, ASIN etc.,)

1. Timeframe: June 2021 (1st till 30th) 

2. We are looking for contact IDs in North America Consumer Space which have RMAs created and customer have contacted Customer service after returning the item checking for their refund. This can probably be achieved by looking for contact IDs where SIC selected was ""Return processing delayed by FC""  by the CSA. 

3.  Pls check if we can have return center link mapped against each contact ID. 

4. If possible, pls map the date when the carrier received the item submission from customer in DD/MM/YYYY format

5. Date on which customer contacted customer service in DD/MM/YYYY format

6. If possible, pls add a row where we can see the difference in the number of days for 
-Day on which customer contacted CS - (minus) Day on which the carrier received the item from customer. 

7. Align the promo if any issued on the contact , we would be looking for the value of Promo in $

8. Was any concession issued? Yes/No , if Yes, then what was the value of concession in $. Concession can be considered as a refund initiated by customer service associate.  

7. Mode of concession - OPM/ GC 




D.  What are the filters that you think we should apply.(If not sure, please schedule a meeting with Analyst once the SIM is assigned based on Description - eg: Contact type = email, chat / Region = IN, NA / Amazon Hierarchy = Consumer)

Contact Type:

1. 150 contact IDs from NA Message Us (June 2021) : However, if possible Pls give us all contact IDs in June 2021 for NA MU

Data mentioning the contact ID's and account ID's where customer's from the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Assam, Odisha, Sikkim and Nagaland have reached us reporting/raising their concern about Dream 11 coupons they've unlocked for transactions made on their Amazon account.

Reason for request :  Dream 11 coupons which are being unlocked when customers are paying bills or while placing the orders. However, we've learnt that Dream 11 is currently banned in the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Assam, Odisha, Sikkim and Nagaland. Hence, as it wouldn't be useful for the customers and we need this data for getting necessary changes to be made wrt this coupon.

I would be available for 10 AM - 7 PM shift from Sun-Thurs.
Back-up login : smorse@ 10 AM - 7 PM shift from Tues-Sat

We need few additional version of the same query but with a different approach.

Changes: 1) Number of instances where the customer have called us more than five times for the same issue ( We will link it to customer id)
2) if customer contacted us for 20 times for the same issue, then this will be counted as one and not 15 (Current query captures it as 15)

In the month of Dec’20, 4 agents from my team were on HR Other (FTC) leaves from 1st Dec’20 to 7th Dec’20. 
One agent was aligned to other TM owing to shift exception but she was incorrectly aligned to me for 2 weeks.

By excluding this my Shrinkage for the month of Dec’20 was 19.32% against the target of 22.21% (As per the Capacity Table).

It is noticed that CSAs are placing the call on hold as soon as they accept the incoming call and continue to be on hold until the customer disconnects,

This results in repeat contacts and poor customer experience.

Hence requesting you to provide the data of hold abandoned contacts to understand the impact on call flow and customer experience.

Data request is for VCS IND, HYD,CJB10,PNQ10,DEL18.

Please provide the data from January 2021- May 2021.
